This package provides OpenAPI documentation Python decorators for
Django REST Framework APIViews.

This module provides a patched SchemaGenerator that enhances current
CoreAPI-based data that is grabbed by REST Framework with
documentation provided by decorators found in this package.

We allow documenting different response types and formats, and each
HTTP status code along with a schema and examples of the expected
outcome.

We also provide optional API comments based on the function's
docstrings.
